# Differential Drive Robot Control

## Overview

This repository contains the code for modeling a differential drive robot and implementing control using PID and MPC controllers.

### Class Information

- **Course Name:** CSC-340 Scientific Computing
- **Instructor:** Professor Dr. Saeidi
- **Institution:** University of North Carolina Wilmington

### Contributors

This group assignment was completed by:
- Leo Doak (me)
- Audrey Warrene

The project spanned the entire semester and was implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python along with Markdown/LaTeX code. Key libraries utilized include:

- Matplotlib / Matplotlib.pyplot
- Numpy
- DO-MPC
- Matplotlib.animation / FuncAnimation
- Casadi / Casadi.tools

### Acknowledgments

Some code snippets used in this project were adapted from the course materials provided during class.

**Additional Notes:**

The original prompt for the project can be seen in the repository in the file called “CSC-340-DDR-Project-Prompt”. From this original first prompt, we were then assigned to implement controllers such as PID and MPC.

The markdown cells did not display the markdown correctly. So a pdf was created that kept the markdown in the correct formating. I used https://www.convert.ploomber.io/ to convert my .ipynb to a pdf. 

Also in the respository is our Powerpoint Presentation that in two file formats, .pptx  and .pdf. The Powerpoint format is not viewabale on Github but if downloaded the animations on slide 8 will function. The pdf is viewable on Github but the animations on slide 8 do not function. This presentation was used to present our work to our class and Professsor. We recieved positive feedback for our presentation and our work.

**Requirements:**

*In order for Do-MPC to work, you may have to install do-mpc via this code:*

```bash
pip install do-mpc[full]
