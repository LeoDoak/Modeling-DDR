# Differential Drive Robot Control

## Overview

This repository contains the code for modeling a differential drive robot and implementing control using PID and MPC controllers.

### Class Information

- **Course Name:** CSC-340 Scientific Computing
- **Instructor:** Professor Dr. Saeidi
- **Institution:** University of North Carolina Wilmington

### Contributors

This group assignment was completed by:
- Leo Doak (me)
- Audrey Warrene

The project spanned the entire semester and was implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python along with Markdown/LaTeX code. Key libraries utilized include:

- Matplotlib / Matplotlib.pyplot
- Numpy
- DO-MPC
- Matplotlib.animation / FuncAnimation
- Casadi / Casadi.tools

### Acknowledgments

Some code snippets used in this project were adapted from the course materials provided during class.

**Additional Notes:**

The original prompt for the project can be seen in the repository in the file called “CSC-340-DDR-Project-Prompt”. From this original first prompt, we were then assigned to implement controllers such as PID and MPC.

The markdown cells did not display the markdown correctly. So a pdf was created that kept the markdown in the correct formating. I used https://www.convert.ploomber.io/ to convert my .ipynb to a pdf.

**Requirements:**

*In order for Do-MPC to work, you may have to install do-mpc via this code:*

```bash
pip install do-mpc[full]
